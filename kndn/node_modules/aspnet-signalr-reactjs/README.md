# signalr-no-jquery

## SignalR JS Client with shimmed jQuery not polluting global namespace

Fix connection.appRelativeUrl when backend sits behind reverse proxy.

jQuery shim borrowed from [react-native-signalR](https://github.com/olofd/react-native-signalr)

This version of signalR client doesn't add jQuery to `window` object but imports jQueryShim locally to signalR and exports `hubConnection`.
jQueryShim file contains only bare-minimum of jQuery to make signalR client run.

This package is not for use with ASP.NET Core version of SignalR.

This version currently matches version 2.4.1 of [SignalR/SignalR](https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR) and works together with a hosted Azure SignalR Service.


### Usage

```
npm i -D aspnet-signalr-reactjs
```

#### ES6 Loader

```
import { hubConnection } from 'aspnet-signalr-reactjs';
```

#### HTML

Use just like regular signalR but without $ namespace.

```
const connection = hubConnection('http://[address]:[port]', options);
const hubProxy = connection.createHubProxy('hubNameString');

// set up event listeners i.e. for incoming "message" event
hubProxy.on('message', function(message) {
    console.log(message);
});

// connect
connection.start({ jsonp: true })
.done(function(){ console.log('Now connected, connection ID=' + connection.id); })
.fail(function(){ console.log('Could not connect'); });

```

#### Integration with typescript

If you are working with typescript, there is a matching types package called @types/signalr-no-jquery

```
npm install --save aspnet-signalr-reactjs
```

and add at the beginning of TypeScript file:

```
import { connection } from 'aspnet-signalr-reactjs';
```

Then you can use the connection as you would have before without $.

```
    const signalrConnection = hubConnection();
    const hub = signalrConnection.createHubProxy('hubName');
    hub.on('eventName', (): void => {
        // handle your event here
    });
    signalrConnection.start().done(() => {
        // do some initialization once you know the connection has been started
        // For instance, call a method on the server
        hub.invoke('serverMethod', someArgument);
    });
```

#### Update 4/01/2017: accessing global settings like through former $.connection

Note: This is an object holding global settings and it's not the same as connection handle returned by hubConnection

```
import { connection } from 'aspnet-signalr-reactjs';
```
#### Update 5/11/2021: enable long polling,add apigee form login token for all xhr requests and set xhr timeout to 2 mins.
Sample:
```
options.headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer " + connection.accessToken,
    "ApiAuthorization": "Bearer " + connection.apiAccessToken
};

#### Update 6/4/2021: Fix https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR/issues/3649

send apiAccessToken from service in case of form login. (accessToken being ad token and api access token being apigee token for form login)
